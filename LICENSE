Alright, I don't know much about legal stuff and I'm too lazy and tired to study how it all works.
Here are the rules that must be followed:
1. You are not allowed to take the files from the repo/upload the files to the web unless I give you permission.
2. You are not allowed to sell the files.
3. No doing anything dumb with the files like changing the files to do something to your pc or something like that.
That's all there is to it, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me via Discord: Flight Sim Central#6235
Thanks
